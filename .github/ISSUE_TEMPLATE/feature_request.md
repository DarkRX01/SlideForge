## Problem or motivation

What problem does this solve, or what workflow does it improve? (e.g. "I want to … but currently …")

## Proposed solution

A clear description of what you’d like to see. How would it work from the user’s perspective?

## Alternatives considered

Any other approaches you thought about (e.g. different UI, different export format).

## Fit with SlideForge

SlideForge focuses on **local, offline, privacy-first** AI presentations. Does this feature fit that (e.g. works without cloud, optional cloud, or clearly documented tradeoff)?

## Additional context

Screenshots, mockups, or links to similar features in other tools, if helpful.

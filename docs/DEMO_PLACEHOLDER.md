# Demo video placeholder

**Replace this with your 30–60 second demo.**

1. Export a short clip (e.g. MP4 or GIF) showing: prompt → slides → export.
2. Put the file in this folder, e.g.:
   - `docs/demo.mp4`
   - `docs/demo.gif`
3. In the root [README.md](../README.md), in the **Demo** section, add a line like:
   ```markdown
   [![Watch demo](docs/demo.gif)](docs/demo.mp4)
   ```
   (Use `demo.gif` for the thumbnail and `demo.mp4` for the link if you have both.)

Once that’s in place, the repo will show your demo in the README.

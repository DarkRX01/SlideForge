# GitHub Repo Setup (One-Time)

Do this once so the repo looks good and is easy to find.

## 1. Repository description

1. Open the repo on GitHub: **https://github.com/DarkRX01/SlideForge**
2. Click the **gear icon** next to "About" (right sidebar).
3. In **Description**, set:
   ```
   Local AI-powered slide maker – no cloud, full privacy.
   ```
4. Save.

## 2. Topics

In the same "About" section, under **Topics**, add (or pick a subset):

- `ai`
- `presentations`
- `electron`
- `offline-ai`
- `ollama`
- `stable-diffusion`
- `typescript`
- `react`

This helps people discover SlideForge when searching.

## 3. Optional: Website / social

- **Website:** If you add a docs site (e.g. GitHub Pages), put the URL here.
- **Social preview:** Under "About" → "Social preview", upload an image (e.g. 1280×640) so links look good when shared.

After this, the repo is set. For releases and builds, see [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) and [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml).
